# FAQ
- Q: What is UniGPT?

A: UniGPT is a **self-hosted** solution for sharing OpenAI API access **without directly sharing the API Key.**
It is also a solution for gamedev (especially sim direction) to **embed the ChatGPT into their NPCs and stories.**



- Q: Is UniGPT another Discord-like or Siri-like app?

	A: For official demo, yes it is for now. It's just a possible way to show the ChatCompletion script I made. **(There will be another repo for Unity Plugin version)**

	And ofc I welcome ya to **kindly tell me where you want ChatGPT to enhance your experience**.



- Q: Can UniGPT help me visit OpenAI?

	A: **NO, IT WON'T WORK AS A VPN OR PROXY TO HELP YA VISIT.**

	You need to figure out a way to **let server access the OpenAI.**

	Once server can access, the client can access too since all ChatCompletion requests **are processed on server-side**. 

- Q: What about the license and privacy?

	A: This project follow **BSD-3-Clause license** and **no data will be transferred to outside except the connection between you and OpenAI**.

	This program is only suitable for **research and internal projects development**. **For commercial usage of ChatGPT, please refer to OpenAI official documentation.**

- Q: I have encountered a bug / I want to contribute to the project / I got some suggestions.

	A: Please contact me through social media's DM or email.

	You are also welcomed to leave your issue or suggestions in the repo's **Issues** section and **Forum** section.
